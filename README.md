# Tech News AI Assistant

A tech news platform that aggregates articles from TechCrunch, Wired, The Verge, and other sources, with an embedded AI chatbot for each article. The AI explains tools, concepts, and technologies mentioned in the news (even when the article doesn't) and suggests relevant questions to help users effortlessly stay updated on tech trends.

## Current Features

- Search the web and retrieve relevant sources using TavilySearch
- Maintain conversation context across multiple questions
- Reformulate vague follow-ups based on conversation history
- Modify previous responses with commands like "shorten that" or "explain like I'm 10"
- Intelligently detect whether queries are new questions or modification requests
- Enhance search queries based on question type for better results

## Planned Features

- Fetch and display tech news articles from TechCrunch, Wired, and The Verge
- Auto-generate suggested questions based on article content
- Embed AI chatbot for each article with context-aware explanations
- Build web interface with news feed and chat functionality
- Deploy backend API and frontend for public access
- Add streaming responses for better user experience
